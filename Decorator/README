Here we take the example of a military system. There are two basic types of
soldiers. These are Mercenary, Recruit. The cost of a Mercenary is twice that
of a Recruit. Additionally, we can train each of these in Cavalry, Artillery
and Naval warfare. Each time we do so the cost of training the soldier increases.
Also the ways in which he can fight increase.

DOUBT: If I train a Recruit as Cavalry, Artillery, Navy, it seems i can access
       the methods of the navy class. Though the cost increases due to the
       recursive pattern, I cant access the skills acquired previously, like
       fire, ride etc. I can only access sail. How do I do that ??
