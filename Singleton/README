A singleton class is the one which enforces creation of one and only one object 
of its kind. This is built into the logic of the class with the help of a static 
variable. This variable is initially set to null. But on the creation of a object
of this class, this static varible is set to that object's reference. Any 
subsequent attempts at instantiating the class returns this same object's refernce
again and again, thereby enforcing creation of only one object of that class.
